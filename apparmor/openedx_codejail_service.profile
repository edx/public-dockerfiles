# This is not a complete and secure apparmor profile! Do not use this
# in any deployed environment (even a staging environment) without
# careful inspection and modification to fit your needs.
#
# See https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/apparmor.d.5.html
# or `man apparmor.d` for documentation of syntax and options.
#
# Failure to apply a secure apparmor profile *will* likely result in a
# compromise of your environment by an attacker.
#
# We may at some point make this file good enough for confinement in
# production, but for now it is only intended to be used in devstack.
